So, this is usually my base project that I start with.

1. Install virtualenv (consult google)
2. Do `source bin/activate` in your console
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python application.py` will launch the app into debug mode (see application.py to disable debug)
5. Check `127.0.0.1:5000` for the project in all it's glory
6. ????
7. Profit


A demo can be seen here: http://flask-template-materia.elasticbeanstalk.com/


`db_create.py` and the other db_ scripts are for easy creation / upgrades / downgrades / migrations of databases.  Thanks to Miguel Grinberg for those.
